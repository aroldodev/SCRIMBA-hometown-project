      <h2>The English Way</h2>
      <p>The English Way has two alternatives in Galicia. The route from A Coruña is shorter – 73 km – than the one departing from Ferrol – 112,5 km. Both have much to offer and a long history. They converge at the town of Bruma, following the last 40 km to Compostela together.</p>

      <h2>San Felipe Castle</h2>
      <p>It is the most important military construction in Ferrol. Located in front of the Castillo de la Palma (in Mugardos) and the disappeared castle of San Martiño, the three fortifications built on the Ría de Ferrol were impregnable.</p>
